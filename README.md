========

### What?
This project is a (reduced-scope) fork of [fedora-sysv/chkconfig](https://github.com/fedora-sysv/chkconfig), in which I  
have extracted only the `alternatives` tool.

### Why?
I found this tool very polished compared to other implementations of  
the `alternatives/update-alternatives` tools. I wanted to maintain a version  
of it that can have its own repository where it can possibly increase or change  
it's scope. It's a very simple piece of software, yet it is able to solve the  
problem of program/library/tool version management in a very elegant way.

### Licensing
[chkconfig](https://github.com/fedora-sysv/chkconfig) is licensed as GPL version  
2 or later at the time of forking, and this repository will be licenses as GPL  
version 3 or later, see the [license](LICENSE.md) for more information.
